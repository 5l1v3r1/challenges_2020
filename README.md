# ECMWF Summer of Weather Code 2020

ECMWF Summer of Weather Code is a collaborative programme where each summer several developer teams work on innovative weather- and climate-related open-source software.

Team up with Meteorology, Climate, Atmosphere, Machine-Learning and Cloud Computing experts to develop innovative open-source software.


## ESoWC 2020 Challenge Streams
There are three different ESoWC streams under which you can submit a proposal: 


### Stream 1 - Weather-related software and applications
Are you a weather enthusiast, software developer or a data wrangler? Challenges proposed related to the development of weather-related software and applications are:




### Stream 2 - Machine-Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Are you a Machine Learning enthusiast or a Data Scientist? Have a look at the challenges related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:




### Stream 3 - Cloud-based weather and climate innovations
Do you have a project idea that makes use of ECMWF or Copernicus data but you would need cloud processing resources to process the data? You can apply for AWS cloud credits of up to $5000 for your own project idea. The only requirement is that your project has to be related to a weather, climate or atmospheric application.
