# ECMWF Summer of Weather Code 2020

ECMWF Summer of Weather Code is a collaborative programme run by the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF](www.ecmwf.int), where each summer several developer teams work on innovative weather- and climate-related open-source software.

Team up with Meteorology, Climate, Atmosphere, Machine-Learning and Cloud Computing experts to develop innovative open-source software.

## ESoWC 2020 Challenge Streams
There are three different ESoWC streams under which you can submit a proposal: 


### [Stream 1 - Weather-related software and applications<sup>1)</sup>](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/labels/stream-1)
Are you a weather enthusiast, software developer or a data wrangler? Have a look at the challenges related to the development of weather-related software and applications:

* [Challenge #11 - Creating Jupyter-based OpenIFS training material](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/1)
* [Challenge #12 - Performance-portable implementation of ECRad in Julia](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/2)
* [Challenge #13 - Interactive visualization of HPC performance data](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/3)
* [Challenge #14 - Size, precision, speed -pick two](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/4)



### [Stream 2 - Machine-Learning and Artificial Intelligence<sup>1)</sup>](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/labels/stream-2)
Are you a Machine Learning enthusiast or a Data Scientist? Have a look at the challenges related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:

* [Challenge #21 - Exploring or machine/deep learning techniques to detect and track tropical cyclones](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/5)
* [Challenge #22 - Applying AI capabilities to address Operations challenges in ECMWF Products Team](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/6)
* [Challenge #23 - What is an optimal number of vertical model levels to represent atmospheric trace gases](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/7)
* [Challenge #24 - A simple Global Air Quality Data Classification](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/8)
* [Challenge #25 - Virtual assistant for users of ECMWF online products and services](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/9)
* [Challenge #26 - Forecasting wildfire danger using deep learning](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/10)



### Stream 3 - Cloud-based weather and climate innovations<sup>2)</sup>
Do you have a project idea that makes use of ECMWF or Copernicus data but you would need cloud processing resources to process the data? You can apply for AWS cloud credits of up to $5000 for your own project idea. The only requirement is that your project has to be related to a weather, climate or atmospheric application.

<br>

#### Note
<font size="8pt">1) *Successful projects under Stream 1) and Stream 2) will be eligible to a stipend of £5000 and if applicable, to apply for AWS or WEkEO cloud credits. Please see the detailed challenge descriptions for more details. Terms and Conditions apply.*</font><br>
<font size="8pt">2) *Under Stream 3) you are eligible to apply for AWS cloud credits only. Terms and Conditions apply.*</font>

## How it works

### 1. Application period: 27 Jan - 22 Apr 2020
Browse through the [ESoWC 2020 challenges](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues) or develop your own project idea. You have time until 22 April 2020 to submit your proposal. <br> Take advantage of Github, ask questions and tailor your submission, together with the mentors of the challenge.

Some tips on what makes a good proposal:
- it is well structured and precise
- the solution proposed is technically feasible within 4 months
- it contains a clear timeline with milestones and deliverables

Proposals will be evaluated based on:
- Quality, clarity and structure
- Feasibility
- Innovative approach (if applicable)

Ready?

### 2. Announcement of selected proposals: 1 May 2020
The final ESoWC 2020 project teams will be announced on 1 May 2020. Follow ESoWC on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/esowc_ecmwf) or visit the [ESoWC website](https://esowc.ecmwf.int) and get all updates.


### 3. Coding period: 4 May  - 31 Aug 2020
The 4-month long coding period starts 4 May 2020 and last until 31 August 2020. During this time, the selected teams team up with experienced mentors and experts in weather, climate, machine-learning and cloud-computing. <br> Follow the progress of the projects here on Github.

### 4. Final ESoWC day @ECMWF: 18 September 2020
The ESoWC day @ECMWF is the final day of the programme. All project teams are invited to come to ECMWF’s headquarter to present their project and results and to meet their mentors. The presentations will be live-streamed.
