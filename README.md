# ECMWF Summer of Weather Code 2020

ECMWF Summer of Weather Code is a collaborative programme where each summer several developer teams work on innovative weather- and climate-related open-source software.

Team up with Meteorology, Climate, Atmosphere, Machine-Learning and Cloud Computing experts to develop innovative open-source software.

## ESoWC 2020 Challenge Streams
There are three different ESoWC streams under which you can submit a proposal: 


### Stream 1 - Weather-related software and applications<sup>1)</sup>
Are you a weather enthusiast, software developer or a data wrangler? Challenges proposed related to the development of weather-related software and applications are:


* [Challenge #11 - Creating Jupyter-based OpenIFS training material](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/1)
* [Challenge #12 - Performance-portable implementation of ECRad in Julia](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/2)
* [Challenge #13 - Interactive visualization of HPC performance data](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/3)
* [Challenge #14 - Size, precision, speed -pick two](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/4)



### Stream 2 - Machine-Learning and Artificial Intelligence<sup>1)</sup>
Are you a Machine Learning enthusiast or a Data Scientist? Have a look at the challenges related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:

* [Challenge #21 - Exploring or machine/deep learning techniques to detect and track tropical cyclones](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/5)
* [Challenge #22 - Applying AI capabilities to address Operations challenges in ECMWF Products Team](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/6)
* [Challenge #23 - What is an optimal number of vertical model levels to represent atmospheric trace gases](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/7)
* [Challenge #24 - A simple Global Air Quality Data Classification](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/8)
* [Challenge #25 - Virtual assistant for users of ECMWF online products and services](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/9)
* [Challenge #26 - Forecasting wildfire danger using deep learning](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/8)



### Stream 3 - Cloud-based weather and climate innovations<sup>2)</sup>
Do you have a project idea that makes use of ECMWF or Copernicus data but you would need cloud processing resources to process the data? You can apply for AWS cloud credits of up to $5000 for your own project idea. The only requirement is that your project has to be related to a weather, climate or atmospheric application.

<font size="8pt">1) *Successful projects under Stream 1) and Stream 2) will be eligible to a stipend of Â£5000 and if applicable, AWS or WEkEO cloud credits. Please see the detailed challenge descriptions for more details.*</font><br>
<font size="8pt">2) *Under Stream 3) you are eligible to apply for AWS cloud credits only.*</font>
